### Something about me
I will not dissemble, my professional path is just beginning. I am still very young, I am 18 years old, I am from Gomel, Belarus, and today I see the main goal of my work as the comprehensive development of personal qualities, as well as finding new and interesting acquaintances.  

As for my strengths, I can mention diligence, calmness, non-conflict, diplomacy, and the ability to work competently in a team. I wanted to try myself as a developer for a long time. Even as a child, I was interested in the field of creating websites and their design. It follows from this that my priority area of activity is the development of Internet applications.

### Code example
Codewars kata: ***Johnny is a farmer and he annually holds a beet farmers convention "Drop the beet". Every year he takes photos of farmers handshaking. Johnny knows that no two farmers handshake more than once. He also knows that some of the possible handshake combinations may not happen. However, Johnny would like to know the minimal amount of people that participated this year just by counting all the handshakes. Help Johnny by writing a function, that takes the amount of handshakes and returns the minimal amount of people needed to perform these handshakes (a pair of farmers handshake only once).***
```
function getParticipants(handshakes){
    if (handshakes == 0) return 0;
    if ((1 + Math.sqrt(2 * 4 * handshakes + 1)) / 2 > Math.trunc((1 + Math.sqrt(2 * 4 * handshakes + 1)) / 2)) return Math.trunc((1 + Math.sqrt(2 * 4 * handshakes + 1)) / 2) + 1;
    else return (1 + Math.sqrt(2 * 4 * handshakes + 1)) / 2;
}
```
